    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my second website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">My first thought would have been to run a penetration test on your web application where we simulate attacks and see if the client has any vulnerabilities in their systems. I would have used tools like Burp-suite. The Burp-suite can intercept every single request and allow us to inspect and modify its values before it gets sent to the servers. Before doing this, we need permission, if we did not have permission but notified the client it is up to the client to whether take legal action or not.</p>
        
        <p>You should be aware of some web security threats: Cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and cross-site request forgery. Cross-site scripting, also known as XXS, is a code injection attack that allows malicious code to be injected into a web application. XSS is one of the most common website attacks today. This is because almost all websites require users to have JavaScript enabled.</p> 
        
        <p>What can it do? Well, malicious JavaScript can be used to do a lot of malicious tasks. It can steal a user’s cookies, which would allow the hacker to impersonate you. It can also modify the page and direct a target to another page where it collects the user’s data. These are just a few ways to attack users, keep in mind the hacker can also target the company or the owner of the website. This can be prevented by technical controls and implementing security awareness training for your employees which is often the best ROI of web security.
